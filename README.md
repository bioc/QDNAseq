#### Repositories, Branches, and Versions

Repository [QDNAseq][github] contains two branches: *master* and *release*.
Branch *master* contains the current Bioconductor
[development version][bioc-devel], and branch *release* contains the current
[release version][bioc-release].

The *release* branch of repository [QDNAseq][github] is also mirrored in the
[QDNAseq-release][github-release] repository as branch *master*. This is
because the two repositories use the [Bioconductor Git-SVN bridge][bridge]
to mirror changes to the Bioconductor SVN repository, and the bridge can only
use branch *master* of each GitHub repository.
